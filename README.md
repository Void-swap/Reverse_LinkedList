# Reverse_LinkedList
## Problem Statement
Given a singly linked list, the task is to reverse the order of nodes in the list.<br>
Also Head should point to prevTail and Tail should point prevHead after reverseing the LinkedList.<br>

## For Example :
if Linked list looks like:<br>
<b>1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5</b><br>

After doing reverse it should look like:<br>
<b>5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1</b><br>
